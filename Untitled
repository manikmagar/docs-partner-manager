= Update the AS2 Host Keystore

When your host AS2 keystore is about to expire, follow these steps to update the keystore with a new certificate and private key pair:

. Depending on your organizationâ€™s policies, create a self-signed certificate and key pair, or obtain a new AS2 certificate from your certificate authority.
. Define a date on which you plan to switch to the new certificate.
. Share the new public certificate with your AS2 partners to give them sufficient lead time to plan the certificate switch on their side.

When it is time to switch to the new keystore:

. From the *<host>* page, click the keystore you want to update and then click *Edit*.
. Import the new certificate and private key.
. Enter the key passphrase.
. Click *Update keystore*.
. After the keystore updates, open one message flow that references the AS2 endpoint and redeploy the flow.
+
Partner Manager updates the outbound and inbound AS2 applications in the runtime. The update can take up to 10 minutes to complete.

NOTE: If you have more than one AS2 receive endpoint that uses the keystore, redeploy one message flow that references each AS2 receive endpoint. (Can you have a message flow that references multiple AS2 receive endpoints?)
