= FTP Receive Endpoint Settings

FTP receive endpoint settings determine where to receive or send the following types of data:

* Receive from partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B EDI messages from partners either directly or via 3rd party connections
* Source at host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives application JSON and XML messages from the backend systems

A host, partner, and 3rd party connection can own FTP receive endpoints.

Create FTP receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the Host or Partner pages:

| Description
| User-supplied description of the endpoint's purpose and use.
| No

| Host
| FTP server host, such as `ftp.mulesoft.com`, `localhost`, or `192.168.0.1`. The host must be accessible from your Mule environment.
| Yes

| Port
| Port number of the FTP server.

| Yes, if the server is authenticated.

| Source path
| Path on the FTP server to which the partner or 3rd party connection sends the inbound files.
| Yes

| Polling Frequency
| Frequency with which the server checks the source path for new files. The default is `1 minute`.
| Yes

| Size check wait time
| Wait time, in seconds, between size checks to determine if a file is ready for processing. The default is `1 second`. This default allows a file write to complete before processing.

Mule performs two size checks by waiting the amount of time specified in this field. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to process.

To disable this feature, specify a negative number or omit the value.

| Yes

| Archival Path
| FTP server path at which to store a copy of the file obtained from `source path`.
