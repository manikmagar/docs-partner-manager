= Create and Configure Endpoints

You can create endpoints in the host or partner page or by using the Message Flow wizard.

== Create and Configure Endpoints from the Partner Page

Create and configure new send or receive endpoints using the partner page:

. In the left navigation menu, select *Partners*.
. Select the partner for which to create and configure the endpoint.
. In the *Endpoints* section, click *New*. +
The *New Endpoint* window appears.
. In the *New Endpoint* window, in the *Usage* field, select *Receive from Partners* or *Send to partners*. +
The *Protocol* field appears.
. In the *Protocol* field, select the protocol to use for the endpoint.
. <<configure-endpoint,Configure the endpoint>> according to the type of endpoint you are creating and the protocol you selected.
. Click *Save*.

Ownership of the endpoints (receive or send) is automatically assigned based on the partner from which you are creating the endpoint.

== Create and Configure Endpoints from the Host Page

. In the left navigation, select the host.
. In the *Endpoints* section, click *New*. +
The *New Endpoint* window appears.
. In the *New Endpoint* window, in the *Usage* field, select one of the following endpoint types:
+
--
* *Receive from partners*
* *Target at <host-name>*
* *Source at <host-name>*
* *Send to partners*

The *Protocol* field appears.
--
. In the *Protocol* field, select the protocol to use for the endpoint.
. <<configure-endpoint,Configure the endpoint>> according to the type of endpoint you are creating and the protocol you selected.
. Click *Save*.

== Create and Configure Endpoints Using the Message Flow Wizard

When creating endpoint types using the Message Flow wizard, the ownership of the endpoint is automatically assigned to the host or trading partner from which the endpoint was created. Using the Message Flow wizard, you can xref:configure-message-flows.adoc[Create and Configure an Inbound Message Flow] or xref:create-outbound-message-flow.adoc[Create and Configure an Outbound Message Flow].

== Supported Endpoint Protocols

The configuration of Partner Manager endpoints depends on the protocol used to send and receive messages.

Partner Manager supports the following endpoint protocols:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Protocol | Trading Partners | Backend
|SFTP | Receive, Send | Receive, Send
| HTTP/HTTPS | Send | Receive, Send
| AS2 | Receive, Send | N/A
|===

== Endpoint Runtime Services

Using dynamic configurations, Partner Manager deploys generic endpoint services that can receive data from or send data to different endpoint configurations. Endpoint configurations of all supported protocols can be reused across various message flows and trading partners.

Partner Managerâ€™s deployment orchestration service inspects the message flow and associated configuration objects and determines which endpoint services to deploy or update based on whether or not any new endpoint configurations are added, updated, or removed.

The number and type of endpoint services deployed to your runtime will depend on the transport protocols used to exchange data with your trading partners and backend systems.

Each unique AS2 and HTTP and HTTPS receive endpoint configurations result in the deployment of their own runtime applications. You can view the Runtime application name corresponding to a given configuration in Partner Manager, from the endpoint detail page.

SFTP Receive, SFTP Send, AS2 Send and HTTP(s) send endpoints are always managed within a single generic endpoint service for the protocol & direction.

=== Endpoint Services
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Protocol |Direction |Application Name Prefix
|SFTP |Receive |b2b-inbound-sftp-<Runtime Application Name>
|SFTP |Send |b2b-outbound-sftp-<Runtime Application Name>
|AS2 |Receive |b2b-inbound-as2-<Runtime Application Name>
|AS2 |Send |b2b-outbound-as2-<Runtime Application Name>
|HTTP or HTTPS |Receive |b2b-inbound-http-<Runtime Application Name>
|HTTP or HTTPS |Send |b2b-outbound-http-<Runtime Application Name>
|===

If your deployment target is CloudHub, You can assign static IP addresses to your endpoint applications connecting to external systems from xref:runtime-manager::managing-applications-on-cloudhub#static-ips[Runtime Manager], if your organization or your trading partners require allowlisting IP addresses. You can share the static IP address assigned to your endpoint application with your trading partners for them to allowlist the IP address, allowing the application to connect with their server.
