= AS2 Receive Endpoint Settings

Your organization's AS2 endpoint settings determine where to receive inbound data from trading partners.
One AS2 endpoint can receive inbound data from multiple partners.

Create AS2 identifiers for your organization as host and for your trading partners in their respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner] profile pages.

== AS2 URL

The value in the URL field is automatically generated when you deploy a message ...

An example of the ‘External URL’ with the endpoint details:

https://{DLB-domain}/b2b-pattern-example/{path}

If you are deploying to an on-premises Mule instance with a firewall and load balancer, work with your organization's hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or the name of the instance host. You must replace the `{runtime_host}` value in the URL with the value that is specific to your organization. For example, if the DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com`, the AS2 receiver URL is `+https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/+`.
