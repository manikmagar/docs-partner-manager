= AS2 Receive Endpoint Settings

Your organization's AS2 endpoint settings determine where to receive inbound data from trading partners. One AS2 endpoint can receive inbound data from multiple partners.

Create AS2 identifiers for your organization as host and for your trading partners in their respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner] profile pages.

| Setting | Description | Required
|Owner
|The host or trading partner that owns the endpoint.

|No

|Protocol
|The protocol previously selected in the *Protocol* field of the *New endpoint: Receive from partners* window. This value cannot be subsequently modified.
|Yes

|Endpoint Name
|The automatically generated name used to identify the endpoint, which you can subsequently modify manually.
|Yes

|Description
|The user-supplied description of the purpose and use of the endpoint.
|No

|Private port (when deploying to VPC)
|The checkbox indicating whether or not to use a private port when deploying to a virtual private cloud.
|No

| AS2 URL

== AS2 URL

The value in the URL field is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow to CloudHub that uses this endpoint. You can view this URL by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

If you are deploying to an on-premises Mule instance with a firewall and load balancer, work with your organization's hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or the name of the instance host. You must replace the `{runtime_host}` value in the URL with the value that is specific to your organization. For example, if the DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com`, the AS2 receiver URL is `+https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/+`.
