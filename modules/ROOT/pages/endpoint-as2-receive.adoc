= AS2 Receive Endpoint Settings

Your organization's AS2 endpoint settings determine where to receive inbound data from partners. One AS2 endpoint can receive inbound data from multiple partners.

Create AS2 identifiers for your organization as the host and for your trading partners in their respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[partner] profile pages.

|The host or partner that owns the endpoint.
|Yes

|Usage
|How the endpoint is used. For receive endpoints, the value in this field is `Receive from partners`. The value in this field is automatically generated based on the type of endpoint created.
|No

|Protocol
|The protocol previously selected in the *Protocol* field of the *New endpoint: Receive from partners* window, which you can subsequently modify manually.
|Yes

|Endpoint name
|The automatically generated name used to identify the endpoint, which you can subsequently modify manually.
|Yes

|Description
|The user-supplied description of the purpose and use of the endpoint.
|No

|Private port (when deploying to VPC)
a|When enabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application is deployed to the private port 8092 in Mule in your xref:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[CloudHub VPC]. You can manage the access control to the endpoint via the VPC and the dedicated load balancer settings.

When disabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application is deployed to the public port 8082 by default. You can access the endpoint URL directly over the internet.

This configuration is applicable to CloudHub VPC deployments from Partner Manager only.

== AS2 Receive Endpoint URL

=== Deploy to CloudHub on a Public Port

When an AS2 receive endpoint is deployed with the private port configuration enabled, the endpoint application is deployed on the public HTTPS port (8082), with the traffic routed through the xref:runtime-manager::dedicated-load-balancer-tutorial#shared-load-balancers [shared load balancer]. The value in the URL field is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow to CloudHub that uses this endpoint.

You can view this URL by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow or by clicking the endpoint name from the endpoints list. You can share this URL with the partners that send AS2 messages to this endpoint.

If your organization uses CloudHub VPC without a dedicated load balancer (DLB), your organization’s platform administrator can configure the necessary xref:runtime-manager::vpc-firewall-rules-concept.adoc[VPC firewall rules] to allow specific IP addresses of your
partners to access the endpoint.

=== Deploy to CloudHub on a Private Port

When an AS2 receive endpoint is deployed with the private port configuration enabled, the endpoint is deployed to the private HTTPS port (8092) and the internal URL of the endpoint appears on the *Message Flow* or *Endpoint* detail page.

You can also set CloudHub to automatically deploy newly created HTTP, HTTPS, and AS2 endpoints to a private port via the xref:cloudhub-deploy-options.adoc[CloudHub Deployment Settings].  

After deploying the first message flow using the AS2 receive endpoint configuration, you can view the runtime application name for the endpoint from the *Endpoint* details page or the *Receive* section of your message flow. To configure xref:runtime-manager::lb-mapping-rules.adoc[URL mapping rules] in the xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer.adoc[DLB] to forward AS2 messages received from your partners to the application, provide the application name to your organization’s platform administrator.

Your organization’s platform administrator can also xref:runtime-manager::lb-whitelists.adoc[add your partner's IP addresses to a list of allowed addresses] in the DLB settings to allow specific IP addresses to access the endpoint.

The external URL that you can share with your partners is `+https://{DLB-domain}/{Input-path}/receive-as2+`.

For example, if the name of your DLB domain is `mythical.lb.anypointdns.net` and the runtime application name is `b2b-inbound-as2-zap3`, then your administrator adds a URL mapping rule in the DLB settings to forward incoming requests to the runtime application within your VPC:

image::URL-mapping-rules.png[URL mapping rules in the DLB]

With these configurations, the external AS2 endpoint URL is `+https://mythical.lb.anypointdns.net/as2/mythical/receive-as2/+`.

=== Deploy to On-Premises Mule Instance

If you want to deploy to an on-premises Mule instance that uses a firewall and load balancer, work with your organization's hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or the name of the instance host. You must replace the `{runtime_host}` value in the URL with the specific value for your organization. For example, if the DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com`, then the AS2 receiver URL is `+https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/+`.
