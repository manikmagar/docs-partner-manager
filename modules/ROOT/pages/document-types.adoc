= Message Types

Message types define the schematic structure of the transactions that are received or sent by Partner Manager.

In Partner Manager, a message type can be used in one of the following contexts:

* Receive from partners
* Target at host
* Source at host
* Send to partners

Message types are always managed in the host profile page, regardless of whether they are used for a single partner or for multiple trading partners. Additionally, message types are reusable across message flows for different trading partners.
