= SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings

Your organization's SFTP receive endpoint settings determine where to receive or send the following types of data:

* Receive from partners
+
Inbound EDI data received by the host from partners or 3rd party connections
+
* Source at host
+
Outbound JSON or XML data received on the host from backend applications
+
* Target at host
+
Inbound XML or JSON data sent to the backend applications from the host

A host, partner, or 3rd party connection can own SFTP endpoints.

Create SFTP receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[Partner] pages:
