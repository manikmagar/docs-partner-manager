= SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings

Your organization's SFTP receive endpoint settings determine where to receive the following types of data:

* Receive from partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B/EDI messages from partners directly or via 3rd party connections.
+
* Source at host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives application JSON and XML messages from the backend systems.
 
You can create the STFP identifiers for your organization and for your trading partners in the profile pages xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner].
