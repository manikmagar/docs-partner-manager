= SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings

SFTP receive endpoints configure where to receive data. There are two types of SFTP receive endpoints:

* Receive from partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B messages from partners either directly or via third-party connections
+
* Source at host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives JSON and XML messages from the backend applications

A host, partner, or third-party connection can own SFTP receive endpoints.

Create SFTP receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the *<host>* or *Partner* page:
