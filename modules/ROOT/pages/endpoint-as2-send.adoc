= AS2 Send Endpoint Settings

The AS2 Send to Partners endpoint settings configure the target endpoint in an outbound message flow to which transformed B2B EDI messages are sent to partners either directly or via third-party connections.

A partner or third-party can own AS2 send endpoints. Use a third-party-owned AS2 send endpoint for an outbound message flow for partners that use a third-party connection.

Create AS2 endpoints by configuring these settings on the partner or third-party connection pages:
