= FTP Send Endpoint Settings

FTP send endpoint settings configure where to send messages in the following contexts:

* Send to partners
+
Target endpoint in an outbound message flow to which translated B2B EDI messages are sent to the partners

* Target at host
+
Target endpoint in an inbound message flow to which translated application JSON and XML messages are sent to the backend systems

A host, partner, or 3rd party connection can own FTP send endpoints.

Create FTP send endpoints by configuring these settings on the Host or Partner pages. You can also create these endpoints when you configure an outbound message flow.
