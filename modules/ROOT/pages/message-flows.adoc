= Partner Manager Message Flows

A message flow is the path along which a message travels from its source, through a DataWeave transformation map, to its target. You set up message flows to send and receive messages between your systems and your trading partners.

Partner Manager message flows consist of objects such as endpoints, message types, identifiers, and mappings. Partner Managerâ€™s message framework orchestrates the processing of your business transactions from source to target using these configuration objects as shown in the following diagram:

You can create message flows in one of the following contexts:

* <<inbound-message-flow,Inbound>>
+
An inbound message flow receives EDI payloads from your trading partners, translates them into your internal application message format, and sends the translated messages to your backend systems.

For more information, see xref:create-endpoint.adoc[Create and Configure Endpoints]
* <<outbound-message-flow,Outbound>>[Outbound message flow]
+
An outbound message flow receives messages from your backend applications, translates the message to EDI, and sends the EDI transmissions to your partner.
