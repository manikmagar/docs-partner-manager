= Partner Manager Message Flows

A message flow is the path along which a message travels from its source, through a DataWeave transformation map, to its target. You set up message flows to send and receive messages between your systems and your trading partners.

Partner Manager message flows consist of objects such as endpoints, message types, identifiers, and mappings. Partner Manager’s message framework orchestrates the processing of your business transactions from source to target using these configuration objects as shown in the following diagram:

You can create message flows in one of the following contexts:

* <<inbound-message-flow,Inbound>> +
+
An inbound message flow receives EDI payloads from your trading partners, translates them into your internal application message format, and sends the translated messages to your backend systems.

* <<outbound-message-flow,Outbound>>
+
An outbound message flow receives application messages from your backend systems, translates the message to EDI, and sends the EDI transmissions to your trading partner.

[[inbound-message-flow]]
== Inbound Message Flows

Create an inbound message flow to receive and translate application messages from your partner and forward them to your backend systems:

|===
|Setting |Description |Supported Formats or Protocols

|Receiving endpoint | The endpoint where the host receives transmissions from the trading partner. a|
* AS2
* FTP
* SFTP

|Source message type |The message type of the input payload. a|
* X12
* EDIFACT

|Transform |The DataWeave map used to transform EDI into XML or JSON formats. a| N/A

|Target message type |The format into which the DataWeave map transforms received messages. a|
* JSON
* XML

|Target endpoint | The endpoint to which the translated JSON or XML payload needs to be sent. This is typically a process API.

[[outbound-message-flow]]
== Outbound Message Flows

Create an outbound message flow to receive and transform application messages from your backend systems and then forward the translated EDI messages to your partners.

The following diagram shows the configurations of an outbound message flow. The diagram also shows how Partner Manager’s message processing framework orchestrates the end-to-end routing and transformation of your outbound business transactions from your organization’s backend systems to your trading partners.
