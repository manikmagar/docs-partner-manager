= SFTP Send Endpoint Settings

You can use these settings to set up SFTP endpoints in one of the following contexts:

* Send to partners
+
In an outbound message flow, endpoints on the host from which to send EDI messages to partners or 3rd party connections
* Target at host
+
In an inbound message flow, endpoints on the backend systems that receive JSON or XML messages from the host

You can create the STFP identifiers for your organization and for your trading partners in the respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner] profile pages.
