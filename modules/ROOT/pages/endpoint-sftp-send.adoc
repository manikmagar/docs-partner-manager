= SFTP Send Endpoint Settings

SFTP send endpoint settings configure where to send messages in the following contexts:

* Send to partners
+
Target endpoint in an outbound message flow to which transformed B2B EDI messages are sent to partners either directly or via a third party connection
+
* Target at host
+
Target endpoint in an inbound message flow to which transformed application JSON and XML messages are sent to the backend systems

A host, partner, or third party connection can own FTP send endpoints.

Create SFTP send endpoints by configuring these settings on the host or partner page. You can also create these endpoints when you configure an outbound message flow.
