= SFTP Send Endpoint Settings

Your organization's SFTP send endpoint settings configure where to send messages in the following contexts:

* Send to partners
+
Target endpoint in an outbound message flow to which translated B2B/EDI messages are sent to the partners
+
* Target at host
+
Target endpoint in an inbound message flow to which translated application JSON and XML messages are sent to the backend systems

You can create the STFP identifiers for your organization and for your trading partners in the respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner] profile pages.
