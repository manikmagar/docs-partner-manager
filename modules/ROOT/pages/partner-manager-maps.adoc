= EDI Translation Maps

Partner Manager uses DataWeave maps to transform business transactions between EDI message format (X12 or EDIFACT) and your organizationâ€™s enterprise application message formats, such as JSON and XML.

Use Anypoint Connector for X12 or Anypoint Connector for EDIFACT with DataWeave 2.0 to:
. Create EDI translation maps in Anypoint Studio.
. Import the maps to Partner Manager when you configure inbound and outbound message flows.
