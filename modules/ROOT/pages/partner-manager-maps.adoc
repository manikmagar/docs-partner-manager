= Translation Maps

Partner Manager uses DataWeave maps to transform business transactions between your partner's message formats and your organizationâ€™s enterprise application message formats.

Use Anypoint Connector for X12 or Anypoint Connector for EDIFACT with DataWeave 2.0 to:

. Create EDI translation maps in Anypoint Studio.
. Import the maps to Partner Manager when you configure inbound and outbound message flows.
