= Deploy, Test, and Undeploy Message Flows

Partner Manager dynamically validates the message flow configuration elements for completeness and, as they are completed and validated, displays a green checkmark next to each of the message flow building blocks.

After the message flow is completed and validated, you are ready to deploy and test.

[NOTE]
It is best to test the message flow by deploying it in a sandbox environment. When you verify that the message flow is successful, you can then undeploy it from the sandbox and redeploy it to your production environment.

== Deploy the Message Flow

After you verify that each part of the message flow is complete, click the *Deploy* button to deploy the message flow to the runtime.

[NOTE]
---
For on-premises B2B workloads, deploying a message flow for a new trading partner while using an existing AS2 endpoint to receive messages can result in a brief service interruption for existing AS2 trading partner users.

To minimize the impact of the service interruption, it is best to perform message flow deployments outside of your regular business hours.

This issue does not exist on CloudHub because CloudHub provides a zero-downtime update of the AS2 endpoint application.
---

Your message flow configuration is deployed to Mule runtime engine and you can start receiving messages from your partner. After a message flow is successfully deployed, you can track its processed messages using the *Activity* page.

== Test Message Flows

After you deploy the message flow, send test messages to verify the following:

* You are receiving messages and acknowledgments from your partners.
* The DataWeave map is working and your backend systems receive the transformed messages.

Test your message flow in your Anypoint Partner Manager sandbox environment:

. Send a test file to the receiving endpoint.
. In the left navigation menu, select *Activity* and select the transmission to test from the list.
. Scan for an exclamation point (!) in any of the boxes next to the displayed flow stages. Exclamation points indicate that there is an issue with the transmission. Address any issues you find.
. If the system was set up to view payloads, you can review the received payload by clicking *View payload* next to the *Received transmission* section. +
If you are unsure about whether you should be able to view a payload, contact your B2B System Administrator.
. If you have TA1 and functional acknowledgments (999 or 997) set, review and confirm that they are there.
. Verify that the transmission routed the messages to the correct message flows.
. Verify that the messages are routed to the target system and that they were:
* Delivered to the target endpoint successfully
* Transformed correctly

[undeploy-message-flows]
== Undeploy Message Flows

Undeploying a message flow prevents future messages from being processed, or enables you to recover resources that are consumed by a message flow that you no longer need.

You can undeploy your message flow from either a sandbox or a production environment.

The undeployment process takes about five minutes, during which actions such as `Deploy` and `Delete` are unavailable.

[IMPORTANT]
During the undeployment process, do not log out of Anypoint Partner Manager or close your browser window.

=== Prerequisites

Before you undeploy a message flow, you must ensure that your on-premises Mule instances, the servers hosting them, and the server group in Anypoint Runtime Manager called `B2BserverGroup` are active and running.

=== Steps

. In the left navigation menu, select *Message Flows*.
. Select the message flow to undeploy from the list and click *Undeploy*.

Anypoint Partner Manager checks to see if any of the applications deployed to Mule are orphaned as a result of the undeployment. Orphaned applications are cleaned up to release any resources they were consuming.
