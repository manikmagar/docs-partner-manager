= Endpoints

Endpoints define the transport protocol configurations necessary to receive or send messages with external trading partners or internal backend applications.

Partner Manager uses endpoints to receive transmissions from partners and messages from backend application, define transport protocols, and specify message or message acknowledgment destinations.

== Endpoint Ownership

You can assign the host or a trading partner as the owner of partner-facing endpoints to control the use of endpoints within inbound and outbound message flows.

When creating partner-facing endpoints directly from the host or a trading partner, the ownership of the endpoint is automatically assigned to the host or trading partner from which the endpoint was created.

In a message flow, availability depends on the endpoint assignment:

* Any trading partner can select an endpoint assigned to the host.
* If an endpoint is assigned to a specific trading partner, than that endpoint is available only to the trading partner for which the endpoint is assigned.
