= Manage Message Flows

Active message flows between you and your partners don't require much maintenance. You might need to modify your message flow to:

* Change flow identifiers, endpoints, or maps
* Switch from a sandbox environment and reclaiming production-environment resources
* Delete the flow when it becomes inactive

[[edit-message-flows]]
== Edit Inbound Message Flows

After establishing a successful inbound message flow with your partner, you can edit the identifiers, endpoints, message types, or DataWeave maps in the flow.

[IMPORTANT]
Before making changes, carefully consider the impact on your existing message flow.

. In the left navigation menu, select *Message Flows*.
. In the *Message flows* page, select *<Message flow name>*. +
The selected inbound message flow appears.
. In the inbound message flow, you can complete the following modifications or actions:

|===
| *Subsection* | *Actions* | *Deployment Required?*
| Receive from <partner>
a|
* xref:create-endpoint.adoc[Add a new or edit the existing endpoint]
* xref:partner-manager-identifiers.adoc[Add a new or edit the existing identifier]
| yes or no

| Receiving endpoint <endpoint name>

[start=4]
. Verify that any modified sections of the flow show a green checkmark next to them and then click *Deploy* to deploy the configurations to Mule.
+
[NOTE]
It can take five minutes or so for your configuration changes to sync with Mule.
+
. To test your edited message flow, see xref:deploy-message-flows.adoc[Deploy and Test Message Flows].

After you confirm the successful deployment of your message flow, you can track its processed messages from the *Activity* page.

== Edit Outbound Message Flows

After establishing a successful outbound message flow with your partner, you can edit the identifiers, endpoints, message types, or DataWeave maps in the flow.

[IMPORTANT]
Before making changes, carefully consider the impact on your existing message flow.


. In the left navigation menu, select *Message Flows*.
. In the *Message flows* page, select *<Message flow name>*. +
The selected outbound message flow appears.

After you confirm the successful deployment of your message flow, you can track its processed messages from the *Activity* page.

[[delete-message-flows]]
== Delete Message Flows

You might want to delete a message flow when it no longer serves its purpose, for example, if your relationship with your partner changes.

You can delete your message flow from either a sandbox or a production environment.

If you delete a message flow before it is deployed, it does not affect the Mule apps.

[NOTE]
For on-premises installations, you must xref:deploy-message-flows#undeploy-message-flows[undeploy a message flow] before you can delete it.

=== Steps

After the undeployment is successful, you can delete the message flow:

. In the left navigation menu, select *Message Flows*.
. Select the message flow to delete from the list and click *Delete* in the upper right of the screen.

Any previous transmissions that were created as a result of a message being processed by the message flow you deleted have the following behavior:

* The transmissions continue to stay in the transmission records within the *Activity* page; however, the records indicate that the corresponding message flow used to process the transmission is now deleted.
* These activities are converted into read-only mode, so no links to the message flow work.
* Only links to the stored payloads (such as the original B2B message, any TA1 acknowledgments, the transformed payload, on so on) continue to work.
