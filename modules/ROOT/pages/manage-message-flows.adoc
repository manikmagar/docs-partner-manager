= Edit Message Flow Settings

Active message flows between you and your partners don't require much maintenance. However, you might need to:

* Change flow identifiers, endpoints, or maps.
* Switch from a sandbox environment and reclaim production-environment resources.
* Delete the flow when it becomes inactive, as described in xref:delete-message-flows.adoc[Delete a Message Flow].

[IMPORTANT]
Before making changes, carefully consider the impact on the message flow.
