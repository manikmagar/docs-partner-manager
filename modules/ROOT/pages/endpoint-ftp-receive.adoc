= FTP Receive Endpoint Settings

FTP receive endpoint settings determine where to receive or send data in the following contexts:

* Receive from partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B messages from partners either directly or via third party connections.
+
A host, partner, or third party connection can own FTP receive from partners endpoints.
+
* Source at host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives messages from the backend applications.

Create FTP receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the Host or Partner pages. You can also create these endpoints when you configure an outbound message flow.
