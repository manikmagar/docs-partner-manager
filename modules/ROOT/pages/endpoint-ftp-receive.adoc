= FTP Receive Endpoint Settings

You can use these settings to set up FTP endpoints in one of the following contexts:

* Receive from partners +
Receive inbound EDI files from your trading partners used in inbound message flows
* Source at host +
Receive application messages (in JSON or XML format) from your backend applications used in outbound message flows

You can create the FTP identifiers for your organization and for your trading partners in the profile pages xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner].
