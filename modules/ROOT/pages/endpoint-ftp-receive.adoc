You can use these settings to set up FTP endpoints in one of the following contexts:

* Receive messages directly from partners
+
Receive inbound EDI files directly from the trading partners used in inbound message flows
* Receive messages from partners through 3rd party connections
+
Receive inbound EDI files from the trading partners used in inbound message flows through 3rd party connection endpoints
* Source at host

You can create the FTP identifiers for your organization and trading partners in the xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[partner] settings pages.
