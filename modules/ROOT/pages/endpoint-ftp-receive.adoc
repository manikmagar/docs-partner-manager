= FTP Receive Endpoint Settings

Your organization's FTP receive endpoint settings determine where to receive data in the following contexts:

* Receive from partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B/EDI messages from partners directly or via 3rd party connections.
+
* Source at host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives application JSON and XML messages from the backend systems.

Configure an FTP endpoint from the host page or partner page:

| Size check wait time
| Wait time, in seconds, between size checks to determine if a file is ready for processing. The default is `1 second`. This default allows a file write to complete before processing.

Mule performs two size checks by waiting the amount of time specified in the `Size check wait time` field. If








 both checks return the same value, the file is ready to process.
