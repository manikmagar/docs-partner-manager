= Outbound Message Routing

The Partner Manager outbound message processing framework enables you to implement receiving endpoints in a variety of ways:

You can:

* Use a single endpoint to receive different types of application messages, such as advance shipment notices and invoices, from your backend systems.
* Use dedicated endpoints for each message type from backend systems.
* Follow a balanced approach by implementing a mixed set of receive endpoints to receive application messages from backend systems.

When messages are received by the endpoint, Partner Manager routes the payload to the appropriate message flow based on the message type, partner reference ID, and host reference ID configurations:

* Partner Manager identifies the message type:
** Relative path for HTTP or HTTPS endpoints
** File name for SFTP endpoints +
The file name for SFTP endpoints should follow the following convention: `<message-type>_<endpoint-information>.<file-type>`. For example, if your message type ID is ar-invoice, then the file name is `ar-invoice_20210217_1055_000.json`.
* Partner Manager validates the payload against the schema supplied during the message type definition.
* Partner Manager uses the supplied DataWeave map to obtain the partner and host reference IDs and the business key.
* The partner reference ID and optional host reference identifier specify the message flow through which the transaction is processed:
