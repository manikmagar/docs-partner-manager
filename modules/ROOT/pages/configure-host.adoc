= Configure and Manage the Host Profile

Your Anypoint Platform organization or your business group is referred to as the _host_ in Anypoint Partner Manager. In Anypoint Platform, your host name is the same as your Anypoint Platform business group name.

Use the host page in Partner Manager to:

* Add the EDI and AS2 xref:partner-manager-identifiers.adoc[identifiers] used by your organization
* Add xref:Certificates.adoc[digital certificates] associated with your organization
* Create and manage source and target xref:create-endpoint.adoc[endpoints]
* Create and manage source and target xref:partner-manager-create-message-type.adoc[message types]
* Configure details associated with the xref:setup-payload-storage-API.adoc[Payload Storage API]

== EDIFACT Global Receive Settings

When EDIFACT messages received from your trading partners do not contain a UNA segment, Partner Manager uses the delimiters specified on the *Global EDIFACT settings: Receive from partners* window  to parse the received EDIFACT payloads. These settings are defined under the host organizationâ€™s profile:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description |Default Value
| Data element separator | Data element separator character | +
|Component separator | Component element separator character | :
|Repetition separator | Repetition separator character | *
| Segment terminator | Segment terminator character | '
| Release character | Release character | ?
