== Inbound Message Routing

To ensure successful routing when your partners send messages to the configured source endpoints, ensure that they use the appropriate message ID or file naming pattern, especially for non-EDI messages.

The following table describes the requirements for successful inbound message routing:

|===
|Protocol | Requirements for Successful Inbound Message Routing
|HTTP or HTTPS
a|
* The message posted to the endpoint has the appropriate Content-Type.
* If the source message type is X12 or EDIFACT, the message is posted to the base URL.
* If the source message type is XML or JSON, the message is sent to the endpointâ€™s `{baseURL}/{message-type}`.
|AS2
a|
* The message posted to the endpoint has the appropriate AS2 MIME type.
* If the source message type is XML or JSON, the file name begins with `{message-type-identifier}_`.
| FTP or SFTP
a|
* If configured to support the JSON or XML message format, the filename begins with `{message-type-identifier}_`.
* If configured to support EDIFACT or X12, the file can have any name because routing happens automatically based on the EDI identifiers and message type.
